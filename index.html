        // The entire documentation for the "Hi" language, written in Markdown.
        const markdownContent = `
# Say Hi to Hi ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to **Hi**. A new programming language born from a simple idea: what if code was less about words and more about intent? Inspired by the elegance of JavaScript but redesigned from the ground up, Hi uses symbols as its core.

This isn't just a stylistic choice. It's a philosophy. By removing keyword barriers, we create a language that feels more universal. It's for the code golfer who loves conciseness, for the AI that needs to parse and generate logic without linguistic bias, and for the developer who dreams of a more fluid, expressive tool.

Writing in Hi feels less like typing and more like composing. Let's begin.

The first thing you'll ever do is, of course, say "Hi". The underscore \`_\` is our universal "output" function.

\`\`\`javascript
// This is hello world in Hi
_("Hi world")
\`\`\`

## Variables: Giving Things a Name

Hi separates the act of *creating* a name from *changing* what it points to. This clarity is fundamental.

- \`:\` is for **Declaration**. It brings a variable into existence.
- \`=\` is for **Assignment**. It changes the value of an existing variable.

\`\`\`javascript
// Declare a 'user' variable and initialize it
user: "Alex"

// Assign a new value to 'user'
user = "Alex Prime"

_(user) // Prints "Alex Prime"
\`\`\`

## The Heart of Hi: The Block \`{}\`

This is where everything changes. In most languages, \`{}\` might define an object, a scope, or a function body. In Hi, it does all of that, all at once. It creates a **Block**.

A Block is a container for both state (properties) and behavior (executable code). It is simultaneously an object and a function. This unification is incredibly powerful.

### The Block as a Function
A Block with no named properties inside is treated as a simple function.

\`\`\`javascript
sayHi: {
  _("Hi from inside a Block!")
}

sayHi() // Executes the code inside
\`\`\`

### The Block as an Object
When you add named properties, it behaves like an object. Properties are public by default. Use \`#\` to make them private.

\`\`\`javascript
player: {
  name: "Orion", // public property
  #hp: 100        // private property, inaccessible from outside
}

_(player.name) // Prints "Orion"
// _(player.#hp) // This would cause an error
\`\`\`

### The Hybrid: Where the Magic Happens
Here is the true power of the Block. It can hold both executable code and state, including private state.

\`\`\`javascript
counter: {
  #value: 0 // A private, encapsulated state

  inc: {
    #value = #value + 1
    _("Count is now: " + #value)
  },

  get: {
    #value // last expression is returned
  }
}

counter.inc() // Prints "Count is now: 1"
counter.inc() // Prints "Count is now: 2"
_(counter.get()) // Prints 2
\`\`\`

This feels... right. In JavaScript, to achieve this encapsulation, you'd need a Class or a closure pattern. The state (\`value\`) would either be part of a public \`this\` or live outside the object itself, feeling like a workaround. In Hi, the state and the methods that operate on it live together in a single, elegant, self-contained unit. It's modularity perfected.

### Blocks with Parameters
Naturally, Blocks can accept parameters, just like functions.

\`\`\`javascript
greet: (name) {
  _("Hi, " + name)
}

greet("Orion") // Prints "Hi, Orion"
\`\`\`

## Truth, Lies, and Flow

Hi simplifies logic to its bare essentials. There are no \`true\`, \`false\`, or \`null\` keywords. There are only values and their inherent "truthiness". This design is clean and a gift to code golfers.

- \`0\` is the official **falsy** value. It's the one and only \`false\`.
- \`!0\` is the official **truthy** value. It's the one and only \`true\`.
- \`-0\` represents **nothingness**. It's our version of \`null\` and \`undefined\`.
- Any non-zero number is truthy.
- An empty string \`""\`, empty block \`{}\`, or empty array \`[]\` is falsy. If they contain anything, they become truthy.
- \`==\` is a strict equality check, equivalent to JavaScript's \`===\`.

### Unified Conditionals: The Ternary \`? :\`

There is no \`if\`, \`else if\`, or \`switch\`. There is only one, unified structure for conditional logic, modeled after the ternary operator. Its result can be assigned to a variable, as the last expression in a chosen block is always returned.

\`\`\`javascript
// A simple "if"
(1 < 2) ? {
  _("One is less than two.")
}

// An "if-else"
isRaining: !0
action: (isRaining) ? { "Take umbrella" } : { "Enjoy the sun" }

_(action) // Prints "Take umbrella"

// Chained like an "if / else if / else"
score: 85
grade: (score > 90) ? { "A" }
     : (score > 80) ? { "B" }
     : { "C" }

_(grade) // Prints "B"
\`\`\`
This is elegance. One pattern for all conditional logic. It's predictable, expressive, and reduces the surface area of the language.

## Collections and Repetition

The fundamentals are here, but with Hi's symbolic twist.

### Arrays \`[]\`
Arrays are simple lists of values, just as you'd expect.

\`\`\`javascript
primes: [2, 3, 5, 7]

// Access by index
firstPrime: primes[0]
_(firstPrime) // Prints 2

// Mutate an element
primes[0] = 1
_(primes) // Prints [1, 3, 5, 7]
\`\`\`

### Loops with \`*\`
The \`*\` symbol is our loop operator. It takes a condition and a Block to execute.

\`\`\`javascript
// A "for" loop
(i: 0; i < 3; i = i + 1) * {
  _("Looping: " + i)
}
// Prints "Looping: 0", "Looping: 1", "Looping: 2"

// A "while" loop
count: 3
(count > 0) * {
  _("Countdown: " + count)
  count = count - 1
}
// Prints "Countdown: 3", "Countdown: 2", "Countdown: 1"

// Loop Control
// >> is 'continue'
// ^ is 'break'
(i: 0; i < 10; i = i + 1) * {
  (i == 2) ? { >> } // Skip the rest of this iteration
  (i == 5) ? { ^ }  // Break out of the loop entirely
  _("i is " + i)
}
// Prints: i is 0, i is 1, i is 3, i is 4
\`\`\`
